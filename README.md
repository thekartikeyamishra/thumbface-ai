🚀 About The Project

ThumbFace AI is a React-based SaaS application that solves the biggest pain point for YouTubers: creating expressive faces for thumbnails without spending hours doing photo shoots.

It leverages AI to transform standard selfies into "Clickbait-Ready" expressions (Shock, Rage, Hysterical Laughter) while keeping the user's identity intact. The platform features advanced Gamification, Dynamic Regional Pricing, and a Reward Ad System to maximize user retention and monetization.

🌟 Key Features

🎭 AI Expression Generator: Instantly generate "Ultra Shock", "Rage Mode", or "Pog Face" expressions.

🎮 Gamified Experience: Users earn XP, level up, and maintain streaks to unlock perks.

🌍 Dynamic Pricing: Automatically detects user location (US, IN, UK, EU) and adjusts pricing tiers (PPP) and currency symbols.

📺 Reward Ad System: "Watch to Earn" implementation allows free users to gain credits by watching simulated ads.

🛡️ Enterprise Security: Client-side rate limiting, input sanitization, and strict Firestore security rules.

📱 Responsive Design: Fully optimized mobile and desktop experience using Tailwind CSS.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js (Vite)

Styling: Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons)

Backend & Auth: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore Database)

AI Integration: Stable Diffusion / Midjourney API (Proxy)

Deployment: Vercel / Netlify
